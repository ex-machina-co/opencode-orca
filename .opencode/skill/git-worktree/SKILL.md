# Git Worktree Workflow

Worktrees enable working on multiple branches simultaneously without stashing or switching.

## Layout

```
~/dev/
├── opencode-orca/              # Main repo (main branch)
└── opencode-orca-wt/           # Worktree container
    ├── feat-login/             # Branch: feat/login
    └── fix-build/              # Branch: fix/build
```

## Commands

| Command                          | Description                        |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `bun run wt:new <branch> [base]` | Create worktree (auto bun install) |
| `bun run wt:list`                | List all worktrees                 |
| `bun run wt:rm <dirname>`        | Remove worktree and prune          |

## Examples

```bash
# Create new feature branch from main
bun run wt:new feat/auth

# Create hotfix from production tag
bun run wt:new hotfix/urgent v1.2.0

# Attach to existing branch
bun run wt:new existing-branch

# List worktrees
bun run wt:list

# Remove worktree (by folder name)
bun run wt:rm feat-auth
```

## Notes

- Branch names are sanitized: `feat/login` → `feat-login` folder
- Dependencies installed automatically on creation
- Each worktree is independent — no shared node_modules with main repo
